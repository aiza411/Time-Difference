## Introduction

The program takes three integer arguments representing hours, minutes, and seconds for each time and returns the time difference in seconds. It uses a function to calculate the number of seconds since the last time the clock "struck 12."

## How to Use

    ```bash
    g++ main.cpp -o clock_time_difference

3. Run the executable:
    ```bash
    ./clock_time_difference

5. Enter the times when prompted, providing hours, minutes, and seconds for each time.
6. The program will output the time difference in seconds between the two input times.
